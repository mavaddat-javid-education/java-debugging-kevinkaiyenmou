# Java Debugging for Coding Class with Mavi

Debugging exercises from the book ["Java Programming" 9th Edition (Cengage) by Joyce Farrell ](https://www.cengage.com/c/java-programming-9e-farrell/9781337397070)


These exercises have *syntactical errors* and *functional mistakes* (the latter of which the author somewhat confusingly calls *logical errors*). 

Students will correct the syntactical errors and try their best to fix any possible functional mistakes (*'try their best'* because functional errors require attempting to guess at the code author's intention and there is often more than one way to fix a functional error). 

Submit the corrected code as an [update to the codebase](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project) (stage the changes, commit them to the repository, push the commits).
